# Kotlin - Another Baldi's Basics Classic Decompile
[Kotlin](https://gamebanana.com/wips/86465)<sup>1</sup> is a new Baldi's Basics decompile and a framework designed to make modding easier. It is currently a work-in-progress project.

## News
### 26/07/2024
> [!WARNING]
> Please do not download or update Kotlin now, as there are breaking changes which affect everyone's version of the decompile. The school is being rebuilt from scratch and any scripts you have applied or any content might get erased if you update your version of the decompile, as of 26th July, 2024.

We started manually building the map from scratch so we would be able to add tile lightings. Howover, this update is a breaking change. Please read the warning above for more info.

### 23/07/2024
We have just added Tile Lighting. However, for now it is not set up for public use, but it is functional and we will be rolling out an update on in soon.

<!-- TOC --><a name="progress-report"></a>
## Progress Report
Kotlin is currently **In Development**. It is **60%** finished so far.

<!-- TOC --><a name="what-now"></a>
### What now?
You could use the current state of the decompile for your mods but keep in mind that you will have to handle merge conflicts in the future. If you have any questions or issues please open an issue on this repo.

<!-- TOC --><a name="to-do-list"></a>
### To-Do list
- [x] Tile Lighting (currently in work)
- [x] Map Building tool (currently in work)
- [ ] BB+ UI 
- [X] BB+ Event System

## Why Kotlin?
Kotlin features a lot of quality-of-life changes and new features like:
- Optimization
- Text translation
- Subtitles
- Improved item system
- [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MKEgnFOoAUbwTa6okis_CD0ZwFglf9zcTP7tvofs3Z0/edit#heading=h.dn4zq8vy014w) 
> Please note that documentation may look horrible by design

Kotlin was also made because BASIC, another decompile of Baldi's Basics lacked documentation and often, the code was unstable due to bugs.

## How do I use Kotlin?
Since Kotlin is in alpha stage, it will stay in GitHub until further notice. You can either:

<!-- TOC --><a name="1-fork-this-repo"></a>
### 1. Fork this repo
<!-- TOC --><a name="2-download-the-source-code-at-the-current-commit"></a>
### 2. Download the source code at the current commit

Forking this project is recommended because you will be given options on how to sync your current project with the latest Kotlin commit. We can also help with any merge conflicts, as well as any issues you may have. You will also get the benefits of Git's version control system.

Downloading the source code manually is not recommended because you will have to keep downloading the code when we release new patches and bugfixes. However, as said before we are willing to help with any merge conflicts, but for the sake of ease and clarity please look at forking this repo.
